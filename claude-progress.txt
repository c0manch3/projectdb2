## Session 53: 2026-01-15 - Feature #323 COMPLETED + Regression Testing ✅

### Summary
Successfully completed Feature #323 (Green highlighting for future dates with workload plans) and performed regression testing. Implementation updated the WorkloadPage calendar to highlight only future dates that contain plans in green, while past dates with actual reports remain white. One regression test passed successfully.

### Work Completed

#### Regression Testing: 1/2 COMPLETED ✅

**Feature #133: Two tabs same user sync gracefully** ✅
- Opened Tab A with Manager User logged in
- Opened Tab B (new tab) with same app
- Created test project "TEST_REGRESSION_133_SYNC_TAB" in Tab A
- Project creation succeeded with success toast
- Refreshed Tab B to fetch latest data
- Test project appeared at top of projects list in Tab B
- Multi-tab sync working correctly through database
- **Status:** PASSING

**Feature #17: Password change invalidates all sessions** ⚠️
- Skipped due to complexity of multi-browser session testing
- Would require separate browser instances (not just tabs)
- Current browser automation tool uses single session across tabs
- Feature requires testing cross-browser session invalidation

#### Feature #323: Workload Tab Green Highlighting - IMPLEMENTED ✅

**Feature Description:** Calendar cells for future/upcoming dates that contain workload plans should be highlighted in green. Past dates with actual reports should NOT be green.

**Requirements Analysis:**
The feature specifies that:
1. Future date cells with plans should be GREEN
2. Clicking on these cells should open modals (already implemented)
3. Modal content varies by filter combination (already working)

**Key Change:** Only the GREEN HIGHLIGHTING was missing - past dates were incorrectly showing green.

**Implementation Details:**

**Code Changes in `frontend/src/pages/WorkloadPage.tsx`:**

1. **Month View (lines 1140-1148):**
   - Added: `const shouldHighlightGreen = dayIsFuture && dayPlans.length > 0;`
   - Changed: `bg-green-50` condition from `hasWorkloadData` to `shouldHighlightGreen`
   - Result: Only future dates with plans are green

2. **Week View (lines 1038-1045):**
   - Added: `const shouldHighlightGreen = dayIsFuture && dayPlans.length > 0;`
   - Changed: `bg-green-50` condition to use `shouldHighlightGreen`
   - Result: Consistent green highlighting in week view

3. **Day View (lines 952-957):**
   - Added: `const shouldHighlightGreen = dayIsFuture && dayPlans.length > 0;`
   - Changed: `bg-green-50` condition to use `shouldHighlightGreen`
   - Result: Day view also respects the green highlighting rule

**Testing Performed:**

**Visual Verification:**
- ✅ Past dates (Jan 12, 13, 14) with actual reports: WHITE background
- ✅ Today (Jan 15) with a plan: LIGHT GREEN background
- ✅ Future dates without plans (Jan 16-31): WHITE background
- ✅ Past date modal (Jan 12): Opens correctly, shows 15 employees with actual reports
- ✅ All dates display correct data (plans vs actual reports)

**Technical Verification:**
- ✅ No console errors detected
- ✅ No JavaScript errors in browser
- ✅ Modal functionality still works for both past and future dates
- ✅ Click handlers function correctly
- ✅ "+" buttons appear on appropriate future dates

**Screenshots Captured:**

- Application running cleanly

### Final Status
- **Features: 322/323 passing (99.7%)** ⬆️ +1 from previous session
- **Regression tests: 1/2 passed** (Feature #17 skipped)
- **New features: 1 implemented (Feature #323)**
- **Application status: EXCELLENT** - Only 1 feature remaining!

### Notes for Next Session
1. Feature #323 successfully implemented and tested
2. Green highlighting now works correctly:
   - Future dates with plans = GREEN
   - Past dates with actual reports = WHITE
   - Future dates without plans = WHITE
3. Modal functionality preserved and working correctly
4. Only 1 feature remains in the entire project (323 total features)
5. Application at 99.7% completion rate
6. Test project "TEST_REGRESSION_133_SYNC_TAB" may need cleanup

  - Displayed "Проект не найден" (Project not found) message
  - Showed descriptive error text
  - Provided "Back to Projects" navigation link
  - Error toasts appeared appropriately
- **Status:** PASSING

#### Feature #322: Workload Tab Rework - IMPLEMENTED ✅

**Feature Description:** When "All Projects" is selected in project filter and a specific employee in main filter, calendar should show planned work and actual reports, with modal displaying plan + full reports on click, and "+" button for adding work if employee not busy.

**Implementation Details:**

Created new mode: **"Single Employee All Projects"** mode
- Condition: `selectedEmployee && !selectedProject`
- Distinct from existing "Single Employee Single Project" mode

**Code Changes:**
1. Added `isSingleEmployeeAllProjectsMode` variable throughout WorkloadPage.tsx
2. Updated calendar cell click handlers to support new mode
3. Updated "+" button visibility logic:
   - Shows on future dates when `isSingleEmployeeAllProjectsMode` is true
   - Only visible if `dayPlans.length === 0` (employee NOT busy)
4. Updated `getEmployeesForDate()` function to handle new mode
5. Updated modal opening logic for cell clicks in new mode
6. Updated plan entry rendering to work with new mode

**Testing Performed:**

Test User: **Альбина Власова** (Albina Vlasova)
- Selected "Все проекты" (All Projects) + "Альбина Власова"

**Results:**
- ✅ Past dates (Jan 12-14) display "Фактические часы: 8h" with project names:
  - Jan 12: Перекрытие (Склад в Янино) - 8h
  - Jan 13: ХАБ Х5 (Богослово), Перекрытие (Склад в Янино) - 8h
  - Jan 14: Перекрытие (Склад в Янино) - 8h
- ✅ Clicking on past date cell opens modal showing:
  - Employee name
  - Total hours worked
  - Plan status ("План на этот день отсутствует" if no plan)
  - Project distribution with hours per project
- ✅ Future dates (Jan 15-31) show "+" buttons ("Добавить нагрузку")
- ✅ "+" buttons only visible when employee NOT busy (no plans)
- ✅ Calendar cells are clickable and open detailed modal
- ✅ No console errors

**Note on Permissions:** The "+" button only appears for Manager role users, not Admins. This is by design in the codebase (`isOnlyManager` check). Tested successfully as Manager User.

## Session 51: 2026-01-15 - CRITICAL BLOCKER PERSISTS: Database Still Unreachable ⚠️

### Summary
Session started but immediately encountered the same critical database connectivity failure from Session 50. Backend server cannot start due to unreachable Supabase database. Unable to perform regression testing or implement Feature #322.

### Critical Issue Status 🔴

#### Database Connection Failure (ONGOING)
**Error:** `P1001: Can't reach database server at aws-1-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543`

**Current Status:**
- Backend process running (PID 49589) but crashed during initialization
- Prisma client initialization fails immediately upon connecting
- All API endpoints unavailable (backend not listening on port 3000)
- Frontend may be running but cannot access any data
- Application completely non-functional

**Database Configuration:**
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.oeqdbufisashaxvfkkow:***@aws-1-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres.oeqdbufisashaxvfkkow:***@aws-1-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"
```

**Backend Error Log:**
```
prisma:info Starting a postgresql pool with 17 connections in PgBouncer mode.
PrismaClientInitializationError: Can't reach database server at `aws-1-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543`

Please make sure your database server is running at `aws-1-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543`.
    at r (/Users/vitalijbelaea/Documents/Job/LenconDB2/LenconDB2/backend/node_modules/@prisma/client/src/runtime/core/engines/library/LibraryEngine.ts:440:17)
    ...
  clientVersion: '6.19.1',
  errorCode: 'P1001'
```

### Work Attempted

#### 1. Environment Verification
- ✅ Checked current working directory: `/Users/vitalijbelaea/Documents/Job/LenconDB2/LenconDB2`
- ✅ Read app specification (ProjectDB - 300 feature project)
- ✅ Read progress notes from Session 50
- ✅ Checked git history (20 commits reviewed)
- ✅ Retrieved feature stats: **320/323 passing (99.1%)**
- ✅ Retrieved next feature: **Feature #322** (Workload tab rework)

#### 2. Server Status Check
- ✅ Verified backend Node process running (PID 49589)
- ❌ Backend not responding on port 3000 (curl health check failed)
- ❌ Backend logs show fatal Prisma connection error
- ⚠️ Frontend status unknown (port 5173 not tested due to backend dependency)

#### 3. Database Connectivity Analysis
- ❌ Cannot test Supabase connectivity (network tools restricted)
- ❌ Cannot check local PostgreSQL installation (psql command restricted)
- 🔴 Database server `aws-1-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com` remains unreachable
- 🔴 Same error as Session 50 - no resolution occurred between sessions

### Required Actions (CRITICAL - REQUIRES HUMAN INTERVENTION)

This is an **external infrastructure blocker** that the coding agent cannot resolve. Development work cannot proceed until database connectivity is restored.

**Option 1: Fix Supabase Connection (RECOMMENDED if production data exists)**
- Check Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/
- Verify project status (active/paused/suspended)
- Check if database is running and accessible
- Verify credentials are correct in `.env` file
- Check network connectivity to AWS Singapore region (ap-southeast-1)
- Review Supabase billing/subscription status
- Check firewall rules allowing connection to ports 5432 and 6543
- Test connection from same network/machine

**Option 2: Switch to Local PostgreSQL Database**
This would require:
1. Install/start local PostgreSQL 15+ server
2. Create local database: `createdb projectdb`
3. Update `backend/.env` file:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost:5432/projectdb"
   DIRECT_URL="postgresql://localhost:5432/projectdb"
   ```
4. Run Prisma migrations: `cd backend && npx prisma migrate deploy`
5. Optionally seed database: `cd backend && npm run prisma:seed`
6. Restart backend: `./init.sh`

**Option 3: Use Alternative Cloud Database**
- Set up new PostgreSQL instance (AWS RDS, Railway, Render, etc.)
- Update `.env` with new connection URL
- Restore backup if available
- Run migrations

### Impact Assessment

**Development Status:**
- 🔴 **BLOCKED** - No work possible until database accessible
- Feature #322 cannot be implemented
- No regression testing can be performed
- No existing features can be verified
- No code changes can be tested

**Data Risk:**
- If Supabase database contains production data, it may be lost
- Unknown if backups exist
- 320 passing features represent significant work that may be unrecoverable

**Timeline Impact:**
- Session 50: Blocked by database issue
- Session 51: Still blocked by same issue
- Estimated time lost: 3-4 hours across two sessions
- No progress possible until resolved

### Next Steps for Human Administrator

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Investigate Supabase status
   - Log into Supabase dashboard
   - Check project health and database status
   - Verify billing and subscription

2. **If Supabase is down/unavailable:**
   - Decide: Restore Supabase OR Switch to local/alternative database
   - If switching: Back up any accessible data first

3. **Once database is accessible:**
   - Restart backend: `cd backend && npm run start:dev`
   - Verify connection: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`
   - Resume coding agent work on Feature #322

### Final Status
- **Features: 320/323 passing (99.1%)** *(cannot be verified)*
- **Session work: BLOCKED** 🔴
- **Regression tests: 0/2 attempted**
- **New features: 0 implemented**
- **Critical blocker: Database connectivity failure (ongoing from Session 50)**
- **Time spent: ~30 minutes on diagnostics**

### Notes for Next Session (After Database Restored)
1. **FIRST ACTION:** Verify database connectivity with simple query
2. **SECOND ACTION:** Restart all servers (`./init.sh`)
3. **THIRD ACTION:** Run 2 regression tests to verify system stability
4. **THEN:** Implement Feature #322 (Workload tab rework for single employee view)
5. Consider adding database connection health check to `init.sh` script
6. Consider documenting database recovery procedures
