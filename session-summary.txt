## Feature #316 Status Assessment

**Current Progress:**
- ✅ i18next packages installed (Session 32)
- ✅ i18n config created with Russian as default (Session 32)
- ❌ Translation files need to be created
- ❌ UI text needs to be wrapped with translation functions  
- ❌ Language switcher component needs to be added

**Scope Analysis:**
This is a massive feature requiring:
1. Creation of translation structure (locales/en, locales/ru directories)
2. Extraction of ALL UI strings from the application (~300+ strings estimated)
3. Creating English translation files
4. Creating Russian translation files (default language)
5. Wrapping every text string in the UI with useTranslation hooks
6. Creating a language switcher component in the header/profile
7. Testing language switching across all pages

**Recommendation:**
This feature requires multiple focused sessions to complete properly. It should NOT be rushed in a single session as it touches nearly every component in the application.
